# <p align=center>PORTFOLIO

### About me</br>
During my years of studies, I have experienced many forms of technology, especially AI, I was able to learn and added many implementations, and algorithms towards my skillset and utilize it into my projects and future project. I have also gain many relevant hard skills from two of my internships.
</br>
</br>
I have always enjoyed coding, and I am often open to learning new programming languages from time to time when I am available to do so. Therefore, I am quite versatile in multiple progamming languages, but the most proficient language has to go to _Python_. I love to keep up with the advancement of technology by reading and watching news, usually topics that are related to Artificial Intelligence.

## <p align=center>Projects in GitHub
_~Note_</br>
The projects that can be found in this GitHub are a combination of multiple deep learning, machine learning projects, as well as data analysis on certain datasets. The projects found here can be part of the studies for the 'Deep Learning' coursework.

### <p align=center>Deep Learning Projects

---

#### Humans Action Prediction
Source Repo: [Human-Action-Prediction](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Human-Action-Prediction) </br>

Objective: To predict the action that the human is performing

Model Used: Convolutional Neural Networks + Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Sypnosis: The dataset used was UCF101 Dataset, where it contain multiple videos of human/people performing many actions that are catgorizes into different folder.
To corrrectly predict the actions of a person from the video in real time, it is necessary to implement the ability to sequence in real time. The hybrid of CNN and LSTM was proposed
because the combined power of the ability to intricately extract features from static input, and the ability to extract information from the past or sequential extraction is very powerful in this case of input.

#### Diabetes Prediction
Source Repo: [Diabetes-Prediction](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/PIMA-Indian-Diabetes-Prediction) </br>

Objective: To diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes

Model Used: Multi-Layer Peceptron (MLP)

Sypnosis: The dataset used was the PIMA Indian dataset, where it contain diagnostic measurements (such as isulin, blood pressure, glucose, etc.) and the outcome of having diabetes.
By training the model to understand and predict the dependant variable using independant variables, complex neural networks has to be used in order to receive maximum precision and accuracy,
which was the reason for using the multi-layer perceptron.

#### TV Scripts Generation
Source Repo: [TV-Scripts-Generation](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/TV-Scripts-Generation) </br>

Objective: To create or generate new tv scripts </br>

Model Used: LSTM and BiLSTM (RNNs)

Sypnosis: The dataset consists of the scripts from a popular sitcom called 'Seinfeld'. The data is a part of the scripts from season 1 to season 9 of the show. The model used are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bilateral-LSTM (BiLSTM)
which are types of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The idea is to replicate the personality of the scripts and generate new scripts that would consist of the same context that can be use in the show. This is perfect for the RNNs model since
it is able to store the past information when training.

#### Dog Breeds Classification
Source Repo: [Dog-Breeds-Classification](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Dog-Breeds-Classification) </br>

Objective: To correctly classify dog breeds from images

Model Used: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Sypnosis: The dataset contain multiple images of dogs from many breeds. To utilize the best feature extraction method the CNN can be use for these type of data. By using convolutional layers, CNN is best at finding patterns in images
and extract these patterns by losing it dimensionality but keeping its information (downsampling).

---

#### Face Generation
Source Repo: [Face-Generation](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Face-Generations) </br>

Objective: To generate face with and without entangling features

Model Used: Generational Adversarial Network (GAN) & StarGAN

Sypnosis: The dataset used was the CelebA datasets, which contain numerous amount of celebrity images. GAN model was used to conduct and train these samples data to generate facial images with random noises.
By leveraging the use of StarGAN facial images can also be created with entangling features. For example, large noses, glasses, skin color, etc.

### <p align=center>Data Analysis

---

#### Car Sales Analysis

Source File: [Car-Sales-Analysis](https://github.com/skyeded/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Car-Sales-Analysis.ipynb) </br>

Objective: To analyze and explore the car sales dataset

Sypnosis: By analysing and exploring the data of car sales, insights can be made and used to furthur improve or optimize business decision in automotive fields. Prediction is indeed possible when it comes to carefully analyzing the correlation which could be made
from certain period of times.
