# <p align=center>Welcome to my Profile!

### About me</br>
__Hi there!__</br>
I am a fresh graduate from Sirindhorn Institute of Technology (SIIT) in the field of Computer Engineering who is very passionate in the field of artificial intelligence and data-driven technology.
</br>
</br>
During my years of studies, I have experienced many forms of technology, especially AI, I was able to learn and added many implementations, and algorithms towards my skillset and utilize it into my projects and future project. I have also gain many relevant hard skills from two of my internships.
</br>
</br>
I have always enjoyed coding, and I am often open to learning new programming languages from time to time when I am available to do so. Therefore, I am quite versatile in multiple progamming languages, but the most proficient language has to go to _Python_. I love to keep up with the advancement of technology by reading and watching news, usually topics that are related to Artificial Intelligence.
