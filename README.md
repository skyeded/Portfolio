# <p align=center>Welcome to my Profile!

### About me</br>
__Hi there!__</br>
I am a fresh graduate from Sirindhorn Institute of Technology (SIIT) in the field of Computer Engineering who is very passionate in the field of artificial intelligence and data-driven technology.
</br>
</br>
During my years of studies, I have experienced many forms of technology, especially AI, I was able to learn and added many implementations, and algorithms towards my skillset and utilize it into my projects and future project. I have also gain many relevant hard skills from two of my internships.
</br>
</br>
I have always enjoyed coding, and I am often open to learning new programming languages from time to time when I am available to do so. Therefore, I am quite versatile in multiple progamming languages, but the most proficient language has to go to _Python_. I love to keep up with the advancement of technology by reading and watching news, usually topics that are related to Artificial Intelligence.

## <p align=center>Projects in GitHub
_~Note_</br>
The projects that can be found in this GitHub are a combination of multiple deep learning, machine learning projects, as well as data analysis on certain datasets. The projects found here can be part of the studies for the 'Deep Learning' coursework.

### Deep Learning Projects

---

#### Human-Action-Prediction
Source Repo: [Human-Action-Prediction](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Human-Action-Prediction) </br>

Objective: To predict the action that the human is performing

Model Used: Convolutional Neural Networks + Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

---

#### Diabetes Prediction
Source Repo: [Diabetes-Prediction](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/PIMA-Indian-Diabetes-Prediction) </br>

Objective: To correctly predict diabetes based on medical information

Model Used: Multi-Layer Peceptron (MLP)

---

#### TV Scripts Generation
Source Repo: [TV-Scripts-Generation](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/TV-Scripts-Generation) </br>

Objective: To create or generate new tv scripts </br>

Model Used: LSTM and BiLSTM (RNNs)

Sypnosis: The dataset consists of the scripts from a popular sitcom called 'Seinfeld'. The data is a part of the scripts from season 1 to season 9 of the show. The model used are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bilateral-LSTM (BiLSTM)
which are types of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The idea is to replicate the personality of the scripts and generate new scripts that would consist of the same context that can be use in the show. This is perfect for the RNNs model since
it is able to store the past information when training.

#### Dog-Breeds-Classification
Source Repo: [Dog-Breeds-Classification](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Dog-Breeds-Classification) </br>

Objective: To correctly classify the image of the breed of the dog

Model Used: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

---

#### Face-Generation
Source Repo: [Face-Generation](https://github.com/skyeded/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Face-Generations) </br>

Objective: To generate face with and without entangling features

Model Used: Generational Adversarial Network (GAN) & StarGAN
